# -6443-
# The connection to the server 192.168.1.2:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
# above was one of the worst errors that gave me a lot of trouble, i think i spent nearly 20 full hours tblshootting and re-installing again and again
# below links helped me with fixing it

# i backed up and went to /etc/containerd/config.toml around line 125 (only 1 reference for SystemdCgroup) and changed SystemdCgroup = true and bounced containerd
# i see that it was also clearly mentioned in k8 docs itself on https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#containerd-systemd so i wasted time not following that instruction
