# group_names is a built-in variable that automatically contains a list of all the groups (defined in the inventory file) to which the current host (the host currently being executed) belongs.
# acg-cpane1 is part of the group k8s_nodes_controlplane.
# acg-worker1 is part of the group k8s_nodes_worker.
# k8s_all_nodes_private_ips group is a parent group (created using the :children directive) that includes both k8s_nodes_controlplane and k8s_nodes_worker.
# setting the ansible_python_interpreter path explicitly removes the below warning - 
#   [WARNING]: Platform linux on host acg-worker1 is using the discovered Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python3.10, but future installation of another Python interpreter could change the meaning of that path. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.17/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information.
